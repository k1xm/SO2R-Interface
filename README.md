# SO2R-Interface

This is the source code for the SO2R Mini interface program.  This program allows the SO2R Mini to be used with logging programs that use the OTRSP and WinKey protocols. The "LatestInstall.zip" contains the installer for the client, and is what should be downloaded by the average user.
